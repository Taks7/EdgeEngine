Edge Engine its a 3D graphics Engine for Game Development developed with C++ and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/). It has been developed by students of the [Degree in Videogame Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/) of the [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/ca).

## Libraries & Tools

- IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

- Standard Template Library
- SDL 2.0.4
- OpenGL 2.0
- Glew 2.2.0
- ImGui 1.89
- PhysFS 2.0
- MathGeoLib 1.5
- Parson 1.2.1
- Developer's Image Library 1.7.8
- Open Asset Import Library 3.1.1

## Installation

It's easy to instalate the Edge Engine in your computer. Just go in the releases tab and open the assets section, now you can click on the first file and the download will begin. Now you have to compile the executable that you will find in the folder you have just downloaded, and the engine is ready to use :smiley:.

## Engine Features

- **Help**: In that section we can find the information about the license, developers of the engine and the tools and libraries used. We can also find options to download the latest version or go to the wiki page of the EdgeEngine and finally, there is a button specifically to report a bug.

- **Configuration**: Here you can Save and Load an existing configuration of your Engine Window and Render Options preferences. 

- **Window**: In the window section we can find multiple window configuration options. Here you can toggle on/off fullscreen, resizable, full desktops as well as the vsync or adjust the widht, height and brightness of your screen. It is here that you can also select the ImGui prefrences in the bottom section of the window menu.

- **Hardware**: It displays the information regarding your frame rate(FPS) and your computer hardware.

- **Render Options**: Multiple render options that can be toggled on/off:

  - WireFrame Mode: Transforms a mesh into a wireframe by iterating over its faces, collecting all edges and turning those edges into four-sided polygons.
  
  - GL_Depth_test: Tests the depth value of a fragment against the content of the depth buffer.
  
  - GL_Cull_face: Determines whether a polygon of a graphical object is visible.
  
  - GL_Lightning: Use the current lighting parameters to compute the vertex color.
  
  - GL_Color_material: Specifies which material parameters track the current color.
  
  - GL_Front: Culls only the front faces.
  
  - GL_AmbientOclussion: Calculates how much the pixel is exposed to the ambient light source.
  
- **Game Objects**: Here you can add the game objects to the Engine.

### Drag&Drop

Models and textures can be dropped from a directory directly into the engine. That's made by creating a new game object per mesh in the model and the texture will also be applied into that model. 

## Engine Controls

- **W**: Move Forward

- **S**: Move Backwards

- **A**: Move Left

- **D**: Move Right

- **R**: Move Upward

- **C**: Move Downward

- **Mouse Wheel Forward**: Camera Zoom Forward

- **Mouse Wheel Backward**: Camera Zoom Backwards
