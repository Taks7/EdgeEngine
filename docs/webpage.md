Edge Engine its a 3D graphics Engine for Game Development developed with C++ and [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/). It has been developed by students of the [Degree in Videogame Design and Development](https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/) of the [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/ca). You can check out our webpage [here](https://taks7.github.io/EdgeEngine/).

## Libraries & Tools

- IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2022

- Standard Template Library
- SDL 2.0.4
- OpenGL 2.0
- Glew 2.2.0
- ImGui 1.89
- PhysFS 2.0
- MathGeoLib 1.5
- Parson 1.2.1
- Developer's Image Library 1.7.8
- Open Asset Import Library 3.1.1

## Installation

It's easy to instalate the Edge Engine in your computer. Just go in the releases tab and open the assets section, now you can click on the first file and the download will begin. Now you have to compile the executable that you will find in the folder you have just downloaded, and the engine is ready to use :smiley:.

## Engine Features

### UI

- **Help**: In that section we can find the information about the license, developers of the engine and the tools and libraries used. We can also find options to download the latest version or go to the wiki page of the EdgeEngine and finally, there is a button specifically to report a bug.

- **Configuration**: Here you can Save and Load an existing configuration of your Engine Window and Render Options preferences. 

- **Window**: In the window section we can find multiple window configuration options. Here you can toggle on/off fullscreen, resizable, full desktops as well as the vsync or adjust the widht, height and brightness of your screen. It is here that you can also select the ImGui prefrences in the bottom section of the window menu.

- **Hardware**: It displays the information regarding your frame rate(FPS) and your computer hardware.

- **Render Options**: Multiple render options that can be toggled on/off:

  - WireFrame Mode: Transforms a mesh into a wireframe by iterating over its faces, collecting all edges and turning those edges into four-sided polygons.
  
  - GL_Depth_test: Tests the depth value of a fragment against the content of the depth buffer.
  
  - GL_Cull_face: Determines whether a polygon of a graphical object is visible.
  
  - GL_Lightning: Use the current lighting parameters to compute the vertex color.
  
  - GL_Color_material: Specifies which material parameters track the current color.
  
  - GL_Front: Culls only the front faces.
  
  - GL_AmbientOclussion: Calculates how much the pixel is exposed to the ambient light source.
  
- **Game Objects**: Here you can add the game objects to the Engine.

### Drag&Drop

Models and textures can be dropped directly into the engine. That's made by creating a new game object per mesh in the model and the texture will also be applied into that model. Currently EdgeEngine supports .fbx for the objects and dds/.png for the textures.

```Caution: You can only drop .fbx and .png files from the Assets folder that is inside the current project.```

### Modify a GameObject

You can completely transform the selected Game Object, being able to rotate, change position and scale it in the three different axis. You can also select and drop an imported mesh, and the same applies to textures that will be automatically applied to the GameObject you want. Finally there is a Camera Component in the scene that will have different settings that can be modified such as the FOV, the Culling or the View distance and it will also feature the above mentioned transform mechanics.


### GameObjects picking & AABB

Game Objects can be picked from the world using the mouse of your computer and the selected mesh will have a bounding volume (AABB) surrounding it and can be discarded with Frustum Culling.

### Save Models, Meshes, Textures and the Scene

You can save your models, meshes and textures using the panel called Inspector that you will find on the left of your screen. The Scene can also be saved to a custom file.

### Play, Pause & Stop

The simulation can be paused and it can also be stoped, where you will recover the original state of all the scene and using the Play you can unpause the simulation again. You will find this functionality on the top of the Screen, with the top navigation bar.

### Two Windows (Editor View & Main Game Camera)

There are two different cameras to be selected, one being the Scene Camera and another being the Game Camera which is a game object with a camera component. They are completely independant and you can adjust the position of both of them to the place you like.

```WIP: We have tested the implementation of showing the two cameras at the same time, but after an extense and difficult progression of that feature we have not achieved it succesfully```

### Resource Management

At the bottom of your screen, next to the console tab there is an Assets window that will display all the user assets. Dropping new assets will modify the window properly and all the resources are only once in memory regardless of how many GameObjects use it.
